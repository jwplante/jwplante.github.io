                    Developed a Discord bot in a three-person team that allows
                    users to search,
                    queue, vote for, and play YouTube videos in a
                    voice channel for the Hack@WPI 2020 hackathon. It is written
                    using Python 3 and the Discord.py, YouTube Search, and
                    youtube-dl libraries. The project is nearly feature-complete
                    except for a mechanism to automatically play the next
                    track. The project is licensed under the MIT License for others
                    to add to and tinker with.

                    Created an application intended to track visitor movements throughout Acadia
                    National Park, which was then sent to a mySQL/MariaDB database for further
                    analysis in an effort to reduce overcrwoding in the park. Assessed
                    the viability of this data collection method by tracking WPI students as they
                    hiked throughout the park. Afterwards, our group created three recommendations
                    for the park to use.

                    Main responsibilites included development in Android Studio, writing the back-end server
                    in PHP and creating Python scripts to convert the data into a
                    usable format for Google Earth and ArcGIS.

                    Created a website hosting miniature strategy and arcade games 
                    built using the Phaser library in JavaScript and Express as a
                    final project for CS4241: Webware in a five-person team. The site 
                    also supports leaderboards to store high scores using Google Firebase.
                    The site also supports OAuth authentication, so you can log in
                    using an existing online account. There are nine games in total, 
                    so feel free to try them out!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Responsibilities included creating a clone of
                    Breakout in JavaScript (Brick Destroyer on the site) and deploying the
                    site using Glitch.

                    Developed a website for users to upload video clips (mainly consisting of clips of Star Trek TOS)
                    and create playlists using AWS for the back-end and React in the front-end as a part of a
                    five-person team for CS3733: Software Engineering.
                    An administrator interface was created in order to manage user
                    uploads and add remote sits.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally a remote API
                    was created and made available for other sites to access.
                    The website is currently not currently online due to
                    hosting costs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Responsibilities included creating AWS Lambda functions in Java,
                    writing unit tests, and work on the search functionality on the website.

                    Created a command-line application to launch and manage Linux processes
                    as part of CS3013: Operating Systems. The
                    application is written in C and can also launch background
                    processes that will execute asynchronously. This project was
                    created in a two-person team.

                    This project is currently not on GitHub due to it being a
                    class project.
