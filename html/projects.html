                        Developed a multiplayer capture-the-flag first-person shooter game in a
                        five-person team using Unreal Engine 4 called <strong>Catalyst</strong>. 
                        The game was developed as part of a study assessing ways to improve
                        player experience in high-latency situations for cloud gaming platforms
                        and was developed for and evaluated using Google Stadia. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The game takes place in the far
                        future where a fictional organization named the Alpha Federation caused the world to
                        end due to specialized nuclear missiles. Due to the effects of the elemental nuclear 
                        payloads, the survivors of the new world gained abilities to control the basic elements 
                        unleashed by these weapons. Ten years later, a tournament was announced by the 
                        remnants of the Alpha Federation, calling upon the best and brightest warriors to combat 
                        each other in a pseudo-gladiatorial team-based showdown. The grand prize is access to the 
                        Alpha Federationâ€™s nearly unlimited resources, fame, and glory.

                        Developed a Discord bot in a three-person team that allows
                        users to search,
                        queue, vote for, and play YouTube videos in a
                        voice channel for the Hack@WPI 2020 hackathon. It is written
                        using Python 3 and the discord.py, YouTube Search, and
                        youtube-dl libraries. The project is nearly feature-complete
                        except for a mechanism to automatically play the next
                        track. The project is licensed under the MIT License for others
                        to add to and tinker with.

                        Created an application in a two-person team intended to
                        track visitor movements throughout Acadia
                        National Park, which was then sent to a mySQL/MariaDB database for further
                        analysis in an effort to reduce overcrowding in the park. Assessed
                        the viability of this data collection method by tracking WPI students as they
                        hiked throughout the park. Afterwards, our group created three recommendations
                        for the park to use.

                        Created a website hosting miniature strategy and arcade games
                        built using the Phaser library in JavaScript and Express as a
                        final project for CS4241: Webware in a five-person team. The site
                        also supports leaderboards to store high scores using Google Firebase.
                        The site also supports OAuth authentication, so you can log in
                        using an existing online account. There are nine games in total,
                        so feel free to try them out!

                    <p>
                        Responsibilities included creating a clone of
                        Breakout in JavaScript (Brick Destroyer on the site) and deploying the
                        site using Glitch.

                        Developed a website for users to upload video clips (mainly consisting of clips of Star Trek TOS)
                        and create playlists using AWS (in Java) for the back-end and React in the front-end as a part of a
                        five-person team for CS3733: Software Engineering.
                        An administrator interface was created in order to manage user
                        uploads and add remote sits.

                        Additionally a remote API

                        The website is currently not currently online due to
                        hosting costs.
